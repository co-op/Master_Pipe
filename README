OR
/home/brainimaging/Desktop/START_PIPE.sh/run in terminal

3. To access the DTI preprocessing workflows, to process raw DICOM up to and including Tract  Based Spacial Statistics (TBSS) from the pipeline interface:
file-->open-->home-->brainimaging-->Master_Pipe-->DTI-->Click A-->Shift+Click D2
-->Okay (all pipeline files should now be open as tabs in the pipeline interface)

4. Follow steps for each stage of the pipeline.

*LONI PWS (PIPELINE WEB-START SERVER) GIVES ACCESS TO A MULTITUDE OF NEUROIMAGING TOOLS
*LONI CRANIUM SERVER IS TO BE USED FOR PROCESSING LARGER AMOUNTS OF DATA AND HAS THE SAME TOOLS AS THE PWS SERVER
*NOTE: DTI WORKFLOW MUST BE RUN LOCALLY FROM THE MACHINE IN SANDRINE'S OFFICE, ALL PIPELINES THAT RUN ON THE PWS OR CRANIUM SERVER CAN BE RUN FROM ANY COMPUTER AT ANY LOCATION


ADDITIONAL WORKFLOWS:

AIR: (THESE ARE BETA)

-AIRreconcile_v2.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/AIR. This pipeline takes T1 anatomical images as input, removes all non-brain tissue (skull strips) from the images, reconciles them into a common space and produces an average ('Hard Mean') image for subsequent atlas registration. 

-MDT_with_KLMI_multiscale_symmetric.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/AIR. This pipeline takes a hard mean image derived from a group of subject's T1 anatomical images along with their reconciled T1s in common space and produces an atlas image for the given group. This pipeline does not currently work for the given data (GENOVA DICOM).  Contact LONI for further support (see below):

Re: Air Align Linear: cannot read 32 bit/pixel data 

Hello,

I have taken a closer look at your data and noticed that there may be a problem with the orientation of the images, although I'm not sure if this would affect the results. Also, the skull-stripping step did not completely remove non-brain tissue for a few of the subjects. After trying to do some preprocessing, I've determined that simple data manipulation won't work for this case.

In order to provide further assistance with this workflow, I'd like to put you in touch with the developer. Please email us at pipeline@loni.ucla.edu and I'll introduce you to the appropriate person.

Thanks,
Alen 

ATLAS:

-coregistration_atlas.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/ATLAS. This pipeline coregisters the all_FA image produced from the D2_tbss.pipe to the JHU-ICBM-FA-1mm and MNI_T1_2mm atlases through linear registration.

-fsl_stats_FA_JHU_ROI.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/ATLAS. This pipeline allows the user to run statistics on regions of interest based (ROI) for an all_FA image that has been coregistered to an atlas (default: JHU-ICBM-FA-1mm). 

-fsl_stats_FA_MNI.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/ATLAS. This pipeline outputs a tab delimited statistic file for an all_FA image coregistered to the MNI_T1_2mm atlas that is masked by single or multiple fMRI_MNI masks. 

-registration_to_JHU.pipe located in:  /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/ATLAS. This pipeline preforms the linear registration of an all_FA image to the JHU-ICBM-FA-1mm atlas.

-registration_to_MNI.pipe located in:  /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/ATLAS. This pipeline preforms the linear registration of an all_FA image to the MNI_T1_2mm atlas.

DEPROJECT: (THESE ARE BETA)

-A_stats_significant_voxels.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/Deproject. This pipeline forms an image containing significant voxels from a previous randomise-based statistical analysis of the skeletonised data.

-B_tbss_deproject.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/Deproject. This pipeline deprojects skeletonised FA image data back into: option 1 – all_FA space, or option 2 – original subject's native space using inverse warping.

FMRI:

*FSF_Design_And_Experimental_Variable_Files directory located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/FMRI. This directory contains: Design_File.fsf (fMRI experiment template), task.txt (experimental variable file 1), and rest.txt (experimental variable file 2).

-v3_Basic_preprocessing_streamlined_cranium.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/FMRI. This pipeline preforms basic fMRI experiment preprocessing,  automatically updating the Design_File.fsf template for FEAT analyses. 

-v4_Basic_preprocessing_streamlined_medulla.pipe located in /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/FMRI. This pipeline is the updated version of v3_Basic_preprocessing_streamlined_cranium.pipe due to the server change from cranium-->medulla with the new pipeline_v5.7. 

RANDOMISE:

-MatConDesign.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/Randomise. This pipeline generates a design matrix file, e.g., design.mat and contrasts file, e.g., design.con. You can use this pipeline in the simple case of a two-group comparison. Alternatively you can use the Glm GUI to generate these design matrix and contrast files.

-randomise.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/Randomise. This pipeline wraps a simple permutation program enabling modelling and inference using standard GLM design setup as used for example in FEAT. It can output voxelwise and cluster-based tests, and also offers variance smoothing as an option.

SEGMENTATION:

-FASTsegmentation.pipe located in: /home/brainimaging/Master_Pipe/Segmentation. This pipeline segments a 3D image into different tissue types (CSF, grey matter and white matter)

TIPS:

1. chmod -R 755 <directory> (rename permissions of DICOM data to read write and execute for current user, and read and write for all other users)
2. BET THRESHOLD VALUES:
0 – grey voxels surrounding head; bad
1 – minor grey outline surrounding head
2 – optimal, so far
3. Copy (Ctl+C)
4. Paste (Ctl+V)
5. Highlight (Shift+left/right arrow key)
6. Jump to begining or end of word (Ctl+left/right arrow key)
7. Undo (Ctl+Z)
8. Use Home Folder to drag and drop files into the pipeline

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

*fsl_stats_FA_JHU_ROI.pipe can only write out one tab delimited file at a time. Currently LONI does not support the '>>' command line capability to append a new line to an existing file. They have noted this and are working on a solution.

*fsl_stats_FA_MNI.pipe can only write out one tab delimited file per mask image. Currently LONI does not support the '>>' command line capability to append a new line to an existing file. They have noted this and are working on a solution.

*AIR:   MDT_with_KLMI_multiscale_symmetric.pipe needs to be followed up with a LONI developer at the email address provided above.

*DEPROJECT pipelines have been constructed according to the TBSS wiki page, but have not been used, largely because it relies on randomise.pipe analyses, which is unsatisfactory.
